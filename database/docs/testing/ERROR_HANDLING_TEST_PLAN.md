## üì± **Testing Instructions**

### **How to Test Each Case**:

1. **Open the Volunteer Login Screen**
2. **For each test case above**:
   - Perform the specified action
   - Take a screenshot of the result
   - Compare with expected result
   - Note any discrepancies

### **What to Report Back**:

For each test case, please provide:

- ‚úÖ **PASS** - Works as expected
- ‚ùå **FAIL** - Doesn't work as expected (describe what you see instead)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **PARTIAL** - Mostly works but has minor issues (describe the issues)

Test Case 3 (Empty Email): ‚ùå FAIL

## üîÑ **After Testing Feedback**

Based on your feedback, we will:

1. **Fix any failing test cases**
2. **Improve partially working features**
3. **Add additional error scenarios you discover**
4. **Apply the same error handling to other screens** (Pilgrim Login, Admin Login, Sign Up screens)
5. **Move on to location/map error handling**
6. **Add database/server error handling**

## üéØ **Success Criteria**

The error handling system will be considered complete when:

- ‚úÖ All test cases pass
- ‚úÖ No generic "Something went wrong" messages
- ‚úÖ All errors provide clear next steps
- ‚úÖ Visual design is consistent and professional
- ‚úÖ Error states clear appropriately
- ‚úÖ No technical jargon in user-facing messages

Let's get this tested thoroughly so we can build a rock-solid error handling foundation! üöÄ
