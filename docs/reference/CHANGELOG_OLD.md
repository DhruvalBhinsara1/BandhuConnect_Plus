All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [2.1.0] - 2025-09-06 ‚úÖ RELEASED

### üöÄ Major Features Added

#### **Database Organization & Demo Environment**

- **Complete Database Cleanup**: Selective cleanup preserving personal accounts while removing test data
- **Parul University Demo Setup**: Comprehensive demo environment with real-world coordinates
- **Schema Validation**: All foreign keys, constraints, and relationships verified and working
- **Documentation Overhaul**: Updated all database documentation to reflect current production status
- **Production Ready State**: Clean, organized database ready for immediate use

#### **Intelligent Assignment System**

- **Self-Healing Auto-Assignment**: Generalized repair service with configurable volunteer selection strategies
- **Workload Balancing**: Fair distribution algorithm ensuring no volunteer gets overwhelmed
- **Assignment Method Tracking**: Proper separation of auto vs manual assignment metrics
- **Conflict Resolution**: Automatic detection and repair of assignment inconsistencies

#### **Professional Error Handling System**

- **Toast Notification Framework**: Replaced all intrusive Alert.alert popups with elegant Material Design toasts
- **Global Error Boundary**: Catches and gracefully handles unhandled JavaScript errors
- **Centralized Error Model**: Standardized error structure with correlation IDs and retry capabilities
- **HTTP Wrapper**: Enhanced Supabase client with consistent error handling across all operations

#### **Material Design 3 Interface**

- **Complete Map Screen Redesign**: Modern, colorful interface with strategic color usage
- **Responsive Layout**: Percentage-based design adapting to all phone sizes (5"-7"+)
- **Age-Friendly Design**: High contrast, readable text, proper touch targets for all demographics
- **Smart Navigation**: Context-aware screen transitions based on user roles

### üêõ Critical Bug Fixes

#### **Success Rate Calculation Fix** ‚≠ê CRITICAL

- **Problem**: Manual assignments were incorrectly reducing auto-assignment success rates
- **Root Cause**: Success rate formula included manual assignments in denominator
- **Solution**: Changed from `autoAssigned/(autoAssigned+manual)` to `autoAssigned/(autoAssigned+pending)`
- **Impact**: Auto-assignment metrics now accurately reflect only auto-assignment attempts vs successes
- **Verification**: Mathematical proof shows rates stay consistent regardless of manual assignment volume

#### **Assignment Repair Generalization**

- **Problem**: Self-repair service had hardcoded "Dr. Raj Patel" volunteer preference
- **Solution**: Implemented configurable RepairConfig interface with multiple selection strategies
- **New Strategies**: Workload balancing, random selection, alphabetical selection
- **Result**: Fair volunteer distribution and removal of hardcoded dependencies

### üîß Technical Improvements

#### **Error Handling Migration**

- **Completed Screens**: LoginScreen, SignupScreen, CreateRequest, TaskDetails, MapScreen, DevicesScreen
- **Toast Integration**: Consistent error messaging across all user interfaces
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant error messaging with screen reader support
- **Performance**: Reduced UI blocking with non-intrusive notification system

#### **Code Quality & Optimization**

- **File Cleanup**: Removed temporary test files, debug scripts, and duplicate documentation
- **TypeScript Enhancement**: Improved type safety across services and components
- **Performance Optimization**: Lightweight animations, reduced visual noise, optimized rendering
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive API documentation and component guides

### üìä Analytics & Monitoring

#### **Admin Dashboard Enhancement**

- **Real-time Success Rate Tracking**: Live updates with accurate calculation logic
- **Assignment Method Separation**: Clear distinction between auto and manual assignments
- **System Health Indicators**: Visual status indicators for repair service and database consistency
- **Performance Metrics**: Volunteer workload distribution and assignment completion rates

### üîß User Experience Enhancements

#### Improved
