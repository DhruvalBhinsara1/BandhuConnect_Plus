This document outlines upcoming goals and features, organized by **priority level**.  
Focus should be on **critical fixes first**, then move to enhancements and future-oriented features.

## ðŸŸ¥ Priority 1 â€“ Critical (Must Have)
### 1. Fix Bi-Directional View
- **Problem:** Pilgrims cannot see their assigned volunteers, and volunteers cannot see their assigned pilgrims.  
- **Action Items:**
  - Implement **bi-directional visibility** on the map.  
  - Ensure **real-time dynamic updates** for both pilgrim and volunteer locations.  
- **Reason:** Core functionality is broken; without this, the app fails its primary purpose.

## ðŸŸ§ Priority 2 â€“ High (Needed Soon)
### 2. Analytics & Insights
- **Admin Dashboards:**  
  - Monitor volunteer performance (tasks completed, hours worked, reliability).  
  - Track pilgrim needs (requests, support frequency, unresolved issues).  
  - Visualize event flow (active assignments, crowd distribution, engagement).  
- **Key Metrics:**  
  - Tasks completed  
  - Response times  
  - Engagement levels  
- **Reason:** Improves **event management** and accountability; not core for users, but critical for scaling.

---

## ðŸŸ¨ Priority 3 â€“ Medium (Should Have)
### 3. UI/UX Direction
- **Action Items:**  
  - Follow UI inspiration from `/frontend-guidelines-by-amogh` folder.  
  - Maintain consistency in typography, colors, iconography, and layouts.  
- **Reason:** Improves **usability and trust**, making the app feel polished and professional, but not blocking core functionality.  

---

## ðŸŸ© Priority 4 â€“ Low (Can Be Skipped or Deferred)
### 4. Smart Notifications & Guidance
- **Context-Aware Reminders:**  
  - Hydration alerts  
  - Schedule updates  
  - Crowd density warnings  
- **Accessibility Features:**  
  - Multilingual voice guidance  
  - Inclusive, easy-to-understand notifications  
- **Reason:** Enhances **user experience & safety**, but can be added after core functionality and UI improvements.
