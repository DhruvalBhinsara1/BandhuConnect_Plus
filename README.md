## Database Schema

The app uses a consolidated Supabase PostgreSQL schema with:
- User profiles with role-based access control
- Assistance requests with priority and status tracking
- Real-time location tracking with bi-directional visibility
- Assignment system with auto-assignment and skill matching
- Comprehensive RLS policies for data security
- Analytics and reporting functions

**Key Files:**
- `database/consolidated-schema.sql` - Complete database schema
- `database/consolidated-functions.sql` - Essential database functions
- `database/setup-instructions.md` - Setup and deployment guide

## Cross-App Consistency

All changes are validated across:
- **Pilgrim App**: Request creation and volunteer tracking
- **Volunteer App**: Assignment management and pilgrim tracking  
- **Admin App**: System oversight and bulk operations

Changes affecting one app are immediately validated in others to maintain system integrity.

## Development Guidelines

1. **Error Handling**: Always implement graceful error handling with user-friendly messages
2. **Cross-App Testing**: Test changes across all three app types
3. **Real-time Updates**: Ensure location and status changes propagate correctly
4. **Performance**: Optimize for battery life and network efficiency
5. **Security**: Follow RLS policies and role-based access patterns
