# BandhuConnect+ Hackathon MVP Roadmap

## Current Status & Path Forward (Updated: 2025-09-14)

### üéØ HONEST CURRENT STATE

#### ‚úÖ WHAT'S ACTUALLY WORKING

1. **Core Infrastructure**: Supabase backend, authentication, database schema
2. **Location Services**: Error handling improved, but production integration needs final testing
3. **Mobile Admin Interface**: Task assignment, volunteer management, bulk operations
4. **Database**: Clean, consolidated schema with proper RLS policies
5. **Project Structure**: Organized codebase, technical debt reduced
6. **Documentation**: Updated and accurate
7. **Android Build**: Working and tested

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è WHAT NEEDS IMMEDIATE ATTENTION

1. **iOS Build**: iOS build is pending; need to resolve Mac/Xcode access and provisioning
2. **Real-time Location**: production testing required
3. **UI/UX Polish**: Basic functionality works, but needs refinement
4. **Performance**: Location tracking battery optimization needs testing

#### üî¥ CRITICAL GAPS FOR HACKATHON

1. **Demo Data**: Need realistic test scenarios
2. **Mobile Build**: iOS build in progress
3. **Network Resilience**: Offline/poor connection handling
4. **User Onboarding**: Simple, intuitive first-time experience
