# can you tell my ai to have 3 separate color theme guide line with additional light and dark mode with.. use any of this for the perfect match for each side of the app

[https://www.figma.com/resource-library/color-combinations/](https://www.figma.com/resource-library/color-combinations/)

whether it is admin, volunteer or pilgrim.

be as elaborative as you can and also tell it to think of itself if the items you had said don't align with what we have in the app because there are a lot of things in it

Here’s a comprehensive guideline to help an AI choose and maintain three distinct, harmonious color themes for your app’s three sides—Admin, Volunteer, and Pilgrim—while ensuring every theme is instantly adaptable for both light and dark modes. This approach is rooted in proven color theory, best practices, and inspirational combinations sourced from the provided Figma color resource. The AI is also instructed to self-adapt if the suggested palettes do not align fully with your app’s specific needs or unique UI elements.

## Theme Structure and Methodology

For each theme (Admin, Volunteer, Pilgrim):

- Select a unique palette from Figma’s expert color combinations, ensuring strong contrast, clear hierarchy, and appropriate mood for the intended user group.[^1]
- For both light and dark mode, adapt upon each base palette by adjusting background, accent, and text shades for optimal accessibility and visual harmony.[^1]
- Always self-audit: If any UI elements do not align well with the chosen palettes due to function, branding, or contrast requirements, the AI should tweak color choices—adjusting hues, saturation, or contrast as needed while preserving the overall mood.[^1]
- Maintain WCAG accessibility for all modes and UI states.[^1]


## Admin Theme Guide

### Core Palette

- **Recommended Palette:** Blue Eclipse (from Figma \#3), or Neutral Salt and Pepper (Figma \#33) for a professional, authoritative look.
    - Blue Eclipse: Navy (\#1E2621), Cyan (\#B4F2F1), and Light Gray (\#ECFFFB).[^1]
    - Salt and Pepper: White, Light Gray, Medium Gray, Charcoal.[^1]


### Light Mode

- Background: Very light gray or off-white.
- Primary: Deep blue/navy accents (for menu, buttons).
- Secondary: Cyan highlights for active/hover states.
- Text: Dark gray or nearly black.


### Dark Mode

- Background: Deep navy or charcoal.
- Primary: Lighter shades of blue/cyan for UI highlights.
- Secondary: Muted aqua or silver for icons and text.
- Text: White or light gray for contrast.

**AI Self-Audit Note:** If Admin tools require stronger differentiation between elements, add a vibrant accent (e.g., a saturated blue or cyan), keeping the rest of the interface muted for clarity.[^1]

## Volunteer Theme Guide

### Core Palette

- **Recommended Palette:** Green Juice (Figma \#5), or California Beaches (Figma \#18) for vibrancy and approachability.
    - Green Juice: Kelly Green (\#49BE86), Emerald (\#075F63), Yellow Accent (\#FAD05A).[^1]
    - California Beaches: Pastel Orange, Bright Sky Blue, Aqua.[^1]


### Light Mode

- Background: Soft mint or very light green.
- Primary: Lively green for navigation and CTA buttons.
- Secondary: Warm yellow/orange for highlights.
- Text: Dark green or charcoal.


### Dark Mode

- Background: Deep emerald or forest green.
- Primary: Mint/aqua for accents and buttons.
- Secondary: Yellow/gold for active states, to maintain vibrancy.
- Text: Pale green or off-white.

**AI Self-Audit Note:** If there’s high-density data, soften secondary accents to avoid visual overload, and ensure adequate contrast for icons and status indicators.[^1]

## Pilgrim Theme Guide

### Core Palette

- **Recommended Palette:** Desert Dusk (Figma \#8), or Lavender Fields (Figma \#9) for warmth, comfort, and welcoming atmosphere.
    - Desert Dusk: Warm Cognac (\#FFB1B0), Muted Orange (\#F0F696), Purple (\#97F7D2).[^1]
    - Lavender Fields: Cream/Lilac backgrounds, Medium/Dark Lavender accents.[^1]


### Light Mode

- Background: Light peach or lavender.
- Primary: Soft pinks, oranges, or lavender for headings and interactive elements.
- Secondary: Accent with light purple/soft green.
- Text: Deep plum or dark brown.


### Dark Mode

- Background: Deep plum or muted purple.
- Primary: Pastel pinks, lavender, and gold accents to maintain warmth.
- Secondary: Warm orange or cream for highlights.
- Text: Light peach or white.

**AI Self-Audit Note:** If the Pilgrim flow features important warnings or CTA buttons, contrast these with gold or vibrant lavender to drive attention, while keeping most elements gentle and calming.[^1]

## Universal Guidance for AI

- Always compare typical UI element categories with current palette selections; shift hues, increase contrast, or modify intensity as needed for UI real-world alignment.
- If custom branding, legacy color, or UX constraints block a perfect fit, use the Figma example palettes as a creative base, not as fixed rules—prioritize usability and clarity above all.[^1]
- Confirm every mode/pass complies with accessibility guidelines for contrast, especially for text and interactive elements.
